title: "Week-14:-Armenia-and-Georgia"
date: 2025-01-19

# After having Afghan food for dinner late last week I really wanted to do something in the realm of Central Asia and the Caucasus. I rmb seeing Beryl Shereshewsky's video on Georgian cuisine a while back and they had some real interesting stuff and a whole lot of eggplant and walnut.
# What led to this decision?
# 1. I wanted Georgian food back in London but didn't have the right timing to go
# 2. Beryl's video
# 3. Just got a bag of bulgur gifted to me, so I wanted to use it in a way that wasn't just bulgur slop
# 4. I liked the thought of kibbeh but wanted to dedicate at least 3 posts for Levantine and Middle Eastern food
# 5. I had 2 long eggplants I needed to use up in the fridge ASAP

# So now I am brainstorming what I want to make. Obviously gonna have pkhali since that's the most interesting thing from Beryl's vid, and obviously gonna have some kind of meat dish that is either like kofta or a stew. Then some preliminary research into Armenian food (Georgia neighbour) showed me this cool thing called orukh, which is like...minced beef kebab mixed with bulgur and spices.
# That sounded too good to pass up, so that's 1 part of the lunch settled. 
# Third thought was to make lavash, since that seems like a staple Armenian bread. But then at Afghan Chopan the naan they had was like a leavened flatbread that had substance and wasn't just a paper thin sheet, and I wanted that instead. Which then led me to discovering matnakash, which kind of looks like Uyghur naan or really simply focaccia.
# Heghineh Cooking Show's video on Matnakash was my intro to this recipe, and some other research revealed that the deep golden brown colour on the bread is done either through a honey/sugar wash, egg wash, or brushed with black tea. 

# Making the Matnakash came first, since it needs time to develop the starter and autolyse and whatever;
# In a big metal mixing bowl I combined 1 cup AP flour, 1 cup warm water, 1 tsp of dry yeast, and 1 tsp of honey (it was Tasmanian wildflower), then mixed it all up and let the fungus do its thing
